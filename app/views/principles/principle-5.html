        <ul class="govuk-body">
            <li>An agreed group of stakeholders who buy-in to the product vision and roadmap</li>
            <li>Stakeholders who understand how digital works, and who give us space to help them achieve their outcomes</li>
            <li>Alignment across stakeholders in terms of what will get done, and when</li>
            <li>Clear engagement at show and tells</li>
          </ul>

          <H2 class="govuk-heading-l">How we do this</H2>
          <ul class="govuk-body">
            <li>Engage early: get to know your stakeholders from day one. Actively build and maintain these relationships through shuttle diplomacy (regular 1:1 sessions with key stakeholders) </li>
            <li>Tailor communications and conversation – find a common language to determine outcomes</li>
            <li>Complete a stakeholder matrix and review it regularly</li>
            <li>Include stakeholders in your conversations about vision, strategy, roadmap etc.</li>
            <li>Be collaborative.</li>
            <li>Be transparent about what’s being worked on and why, as well as any problems you’re encountering</li>
            <li>Remain available and approachable to all colleagues and be receptive to new ideas.</li>
          </ul>

          <H2 class="govuk-heading-l">What to avoid</H2>
          <ul class="govuk-body">
              <li>Don’t avoid challenge or dis-alignment, tackle it</li>
              <li>Don’t leave it late to engage</li>
              <li>Gaps in talking to stakeholders – it is not a once and done thing</li>
              <li>Don't assume you know what your stakeholders need</li>
              <li>Don’t listen to stakeholder opinion over user and business needs</li>
              <li>Glossing over problems or not talking about them</li>
          </ul>
