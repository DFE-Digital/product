          <li>are bought-into your product vision and roadmap</li>
          <li>understand how digital delivery works, and give you space to help them achieve their outcomes</li>

        <p class="govuk-body">You should complete a stakeholder matrix and review it regularly.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">Get to know your stakeholders from day one.  You should actively build and maintain these relationships through shuttle diplomacy (regular 1:1 sessions with key stakeholders). Stakeholder engagement is not once and done, you should talk to them regularly.</p> 
        
        <p class="govuk-body">Do not assume you know what your stakeholders need.</p> 
        
        <p class="govuk-body">You should tailor your communications and conversation to your stakeholders. You'll need to find a common language to determine outcomes.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">You should work collaboratively with your stakeholders. Include them in conversations about  your vision, strategy and roadmap.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">Be transparent about with your stakeholders what the team is currently working on and why. Also let them know about well as any problems youâ€™re encountering - do not gloss over them or not talk about them.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">Where stakeholders are misaligned, you should address this.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">Do not listen to stakeholder opinion over user and business needs.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">Remain available and approachable to all colleagues,  and be receptive to new ideas.</p>
