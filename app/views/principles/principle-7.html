<p class="govuk-body">This means:</p>
<ul class="govuk-body">
  <li>understanding the context - if you know your product and the space you're operating in, you will make better decisions</li>
  <li>considering the risk - you might not have enough evidence, but taking a well-informed risk might be better than continuing to wait</li>
  <li>using evidence to rationalise - which comes in many forms including user needs, business needs and data</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">You should try to use data from a range of sources. Data we have access to includes:</p>
<ul class="govuk-body">
  <li>data from existing services</li>
  <li>social research data</li>
  <li>qualitative data such as user research data</li>
  <li>quantitative data such as performance analytics</li>
</ul>
   
<p class="govuk-body">Use the data to make your decisions, or arrive at your hypothesis for change. The data will not give you all of the answers, but it will help you to back up the decision you make. </p>
