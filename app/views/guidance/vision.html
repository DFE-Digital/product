      <p class="govuk-body">A vision describes what the world would look like if your digital service succeeds. It is a clear, concise and inspirational description of the desired long-term change resulting from your digital service, or programme's work.  It should be aspirational, but achievable.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Your vision sets a North Star to give you and your teams direction. Your vision should describe what you want to achieve in the future in terms of an outcome, rather than a solution.</p> 
      <p class="govuk-body">Your vision should link to your strategy and mission statement. You should use the same vision across all phases, with a specific strategy and mission statement for each phase.</p> 
      <p class="govuk-body">You should involve your team in setting your vision, which you can do by running a workshop.</p> 
      <p class="govuk-body">You should share your vision regularly â€“ such as in show and tells and meetings with stakeholders.</p>
        
        <H2 class="govuk-heading-l">Writing your vision</H2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Your vision should be written clearly and concisely. You should avoid acronyms and specialist language.  A content designer can help with this.  </p> 
        <p class="govuk-body">You should test drafts of your vision with your users, team and stakeholders, to make sure they understand and agree.</p>

        <H2 class="govuk-heading-l">Example vision</H2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The example vision for the imaginary service Get pencils for schools is:</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">All school age children in England will have quick and easy access to as many pencils as they need.</p>
